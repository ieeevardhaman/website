        <p>IEEE is the largest professional organization in the world and helps its members access
to network with the best brains in cutting edge areas. I joined IEEE a decade back since
then I have gained a lot through IEEE memberships and its daughter societies such as
Computer society, Education Society Membership, Electron Devices Society
Membership, Big Data Community, Block chain Community, Cloud Computing
Community, Cyber security Community, Data Engineering, IEEE Computer Society
Technical Committee on and etc.</p>
<p>My volunteering activities started as the student branch counselor in 2007 and
organized various activities and got applauds from IEEE .That prompted me to do more
and I became the secretary of IEEE CS chapter Hyderabad section. Sincerely then I
have participated in several activities and conferences including general chair, Reviewer
for IEEE Access Journal and Session chair for several IEEE Conferences. I also
became the Vice chair, IEEE CS Chapter Hyderabad section. This shows that if we are
committed to IEEE, we can grow very quickly. Moreover these roles have helped me
interact with several top researchers and experts in our filed on regular basis.</p>
<p>With this motivation, I encouraged many colleges and started IEEE student branches
and societies . Under IEEE I have organized various career guidance programs for
Scholl children also.</p>
<p>Overall my career has been a steep growth towards IEEE and its societies. I am sure
that without my IEEE membership and Volunteering, I would not have been able to
achieve that I have done in such a short time.</p>
